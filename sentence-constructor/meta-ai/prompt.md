## Examples

Here are example of input and output

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
- BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
- BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on translating it into Japanese.
Vocabulary Table
| Japanese | Romaji | English
    |          | kuma	| bear |
    |          | tobira | door |
    |          | gomi	| garbage |
    |          | noko	| leave behind |
Possible Sentence Structure
(kuma wa tobira ni imasu) - Bears are at the door
(gomi o suteru no o wasure mashita ka?) - Did you forget to throw away the garbage?
Now, let's work on combining these parts to create a complete sentence. Think about how you can use the vocabulary and sentence structure above to convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
What's your attempt at translating the sentence into Japanese?

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
